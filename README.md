## 📊 Project Overview
In this project,The goal is to segment the company's client base into distinct groups based on their financial behavior and demographic data. 

By identifying these segments, the company can move away from a "one-size-fits-all" approach and apply **targeted business strategies**, such as:
* **Increasing credit limits** for high-frequency/low-spend users.
* **Creating incentives** for high-income earners who underutilize their cards.

## 🚀 The Workflow
To achieve a high-quality segmentation model, the project follows these five key steps:

1. **Data Analysis:** Exploring the variables to understand client distributions.
2. **Preprocessing:** Scaling and preparing data for distance-based modeling.
3. **Cluster Optimization:** Finding the ideal number of groups (k) using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis.
4. **Modeling:** Implementing the **K-Means Algorithm**.
5. **Interpretation:** Defining the "persona" of each cluster to provide actionable business insights.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** * `pandas` & `numpy` for data manipulation.
    * `scikit-learn` for K-Means and scaling.
    * `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for cluster visualization.
